# "Jewels-Hunt"
# Overview
This project is a 2D platformer mini-game designed to showcase essential gameplay mechanics, smooth animations, and responsive controls in a compact format. The main objectives are to collect coins scattered throughout the level and put them in the box before the timer runs out.

# Features
Platforming Mechanics – The player can run, jump, and navigate various platforms and obstacles. 
Movement is responsive and physics-based for a natural feel. 
Timer System – A visible countdown clock adds urgency to gameplay. The player must complete the level before time expires, encouraging quick decision-making. 
Coin Collection – Coins are placed in strategic spots. Collecting coins increases the player’s score. 
Multiple Levels – This game has several levels with the additional difficulties as player progress level to level. 
Animations – Smooth animations for running, jumping, and idle states bring the character to life. Coins and environmental objects also have animated effects. 
Sound Effects & Music – Background music creates atmosphere, while sound effects respond to player actions (coin pickups, jumps, enemy attack).

# Purpose
The mini-game serves as a small-scale demonstration of platformer design, combining core mechanics, visual polish, and audio feedback. It can be expanded into a full game or used as a portfolio piece to highlight skills in Unity 2D game development, animation integration, and interactive sound design.
